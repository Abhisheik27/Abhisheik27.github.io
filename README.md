## Projects
Here's where the fun begins! Let me walk you through some of the exciting projects I've worked on:

<h4>Weather Forecasting using Time Series Forecasting</h4> 
As part of my coursework during my Bachelor's degree, I undertook a compelling project focused on weather forecasting using time series analysis. Leveraging Python, Google Colab, Pandas, and NumPy, our team developed a robust machine learning model aimed at predicting climate patterns by analyzing variables such as wind speed, humidity, and temperature. We meticulously acquired data from Kaggle, conducted thorough exploratory data analysis, and implemented advanced modeling techniques to enhance the accuracy of our forecasts. Through collaborative effort, we achieved outstanding results, boasting a decent Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Squared Error (MSE), indicative of our proficiency in data modeling and predictive accuracy.

<h4>Document Summarization using Latent Semantic Indexing</h4>
As part of my Numerical Linear Algebra coursework during my Master's program, I engaged in a comprehensive project focused on document summarization using latent semantic indexing techniques. This involved conducting a thorough comparative study on document summarization methods within the realm of Natural Language Processing (NLP). Employing Python and the powerful BERT model, I implemented both traditional linear algebra approaches, such as Latent Semantic Analysis, and state-of-the-art methodologies like BERTsum.  
Utilizing Python for experimentation and leveraging Hugging Face's dataset library, I acquired the necessary training and test datasets for our project. By implementing a summarizer using scikit-learn, our team achieved notable enhancements in precision (60%) and recall (80%) when adopting the BERTsum methodology over the traditional NLA approach.

<h4>Google Trend Analysis</h4>
For the Google Trend Analysis project during my Bachelor's, I took a deep dive into the fascinating world of data exploration. Using R and Google Colab, I extracted and analyzed data from Google Trends, exploring trends in online search behavior. I showcased my expertise in R programming and utilized essential libraries like dplyr, gTrendsR, ggplot, and patchwork for insightful data visualization.

<h4>Climate Analysis</h4>
The Climate Analysis project during my Master's was a culmination of my academic journey. Leveraging Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn, I conducted an in-depth analysis of climate projections using the NorESM2 climate model data. We developed a regression model to predict global warming based on cumulative CO2 emissions and extended our analysis to regional temperature modeling. Additionally, I created a command-line interface for interactive data exploration, enhancing usability and accessibility. This project showcased my ability to apply advanced data analysis techniques to address real-world challenges effectively.
